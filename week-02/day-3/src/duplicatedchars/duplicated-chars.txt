The Zen of Python
by Tim Peters

Beautiful is bettter than ugly.
Explicit is bettter than implicit.
Simple is bettter than complex.
Complex is bettter than complicated.
Flat is bettter than nested.
Sparse is bettter than dense.
Readability counts.
Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
Although practicality beats purity.
Errrors should never passs silently.
Unlesss explicitly silenced.
In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guesss.
There should be one--- and preferably only one ---obvious way to do it.
Although that way may not be obvious at first unlesss you're Dutch.
Now is bettter than never.
Although never is often bettter than *right* now.
If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a goood idea.
Namespaces are one honking great idea --- let's do more of those!
